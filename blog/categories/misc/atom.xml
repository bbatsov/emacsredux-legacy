    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a long period of no development activity (mostly because it was
perfect from the start),
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save/">super-save</a> gets an update
today!</p>

<p>The latest 0.3 version of your favourite auto-saving library makes it
easier to customize the hook triggers (see <code>super-save-hook-triggers</code>)
and adds an option to ignore remote (TRAMP) files (see
<code>super-save-remote-files</code>).</p>

<p>As a refresher - <code>super-save</code> will save modified files automatically
on certain command (e.g. <code>switch-to-buffer</code>) and hook triggers
(e.g. <code>focus-out-hook</code>).</p>

<p>Both of those are configurable via <code>super-save-triggers</code> and (starting
with 0.3) <code>super-save-hook-triggers</code>. Here are a couple of examples:</p>

<p>``` cl
;; add integration with ace-window
(add-to-list 'super-save-triggers 'ace-window)</p>

<p>;; save on find-file
(add-to-list 'super-save-hook-triggers 'find-file-hook)
```</p>

<p>You can now turn off <code>super-save</code> for remote files like this:</p>

<p><code>cp
(setq super-save-remote-files nil)
</code></p>

<p>It seems that now <code>super-save</code> is beyond perfect, so don't expect the
next release any time soon! ;-)</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> <code>super-save</code> was extracted from
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>, but for some reason I
actually forgot to add it to Prelude. Today that changes as well! :-)</p>

    <id>http://emacsredux.com/blog/2016/02/14/look-up-the-keybindings-for-some-command</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you know the name of some command, but you've forgotten its
keybinding(s) there are 3 common options to look the keybinding(s) up.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C-h f command-name</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This will display some information about the command in question in a help buffer.
Important bits of this information include where is the command defined, what are its
keybindingings if any, and its documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C-h w command-name</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This will display the keybindings of the command in the minibuffer. If you're interested only
in the keybindings you should prefer this option over <code>C-h f</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>M-x command-name</code></li>
</ul>


<p>After you invoke some command using <code>M-x</code> you'll see a suggestion to use
its keybinding instead in the minibuffer.</p>

<p>That's all for now, folks!</p>

    <updated>2016-02-14T12:09:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://emacsredux.com/blog/2016/02/14/disable-annoying-audio-notifications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By default Emacs has some pretty annoying audio notifications for
certain events (e.g. trying to move past the end of a buffer). You've
got two options to get rid of them. Option 1 is to replace them with visual
notifications (the Emacs frame will flash):</p>

<p><code>cl
(setq visible-bell t)
</code></p>

<p>This doesn't work well on OS X and is just as annoying (if not even
more), so I'd suggest going with option 2 instead - disable those
notifications completely:</p>

<p><code>cl
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
</code></p>

<p>At last - some peace and quiet!</p>

    <link href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2016/01/31/use-tab-to-indent-or-complete/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-31T09:02:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://emacsredux.com/blog/2016/01/31/use-tab-to-indent-or-complete</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By default in Emacs the <code>Tab</code> key does only indentation. If some major
mode provides completion of some form, you normally have to trigger it
with <code>M-Tab</code>. In most window managers, however, this keybinding is used to
switch between open windows, which makes it a bit hard to use out of the box.</p>

<p>There's a simple trick to augment the default <code>Tab</code> behavior. Just put
this in your Emacs config:</p>

<p><code>cl
(setq tab-always-indent â€˜complete)
</code></p>

<p>Now, when you press <code>Tab</code> one time it will indent and if you press it
again you'll get completion candidates. If the indentation at point is
already correct you'll get the completion candidates right away. As an
added bonus - you don't really need <code>M-Tab</code> anymore.</p>

<p>Simple and neat! One really has to wonder why this isn't the default
behavior.</p>

    <updated>2016-01-30T12:31:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://emacsredux.com/blog/2016/01/30/my-personal-emacs-configuration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From time to time people ask me about my personal Emacs
configuration. Other just assume that I use
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>. For a very long time my
personal configuration was pretty similar to Prelude - in a way it was
a staging ground for things to go into Prelude eventually (although
changes would travel both ways when Prelude users suggest some cool
things).</p>

<p>Recently I've decided that in the future I want to do a few things with Prelude:</p>

<ul>
<li>extract as much functionality from it as possible into reusable
packages (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save">super-save</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/crux">crux</a>)</li>
<li>adopt there <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a></li>
<li>improve the support for Windows (because now I have Windows computer)</li>
</ul>


<p>As part of these efforts I reworked my personal config into something
pretty simple (it's a single <code>init.el</code> file) and I've started
experimenting with ideas for the future. Stay tuned for the results!</p>

<p>The config is available
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d">here</a>. Perhaps some of you will
find something useful there.</p>
