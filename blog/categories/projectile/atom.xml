    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while one of the biggest complaints people had about
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> was that the
<code>alien</code> indexing wasn't fast enough (especially on big projects). The
reason for the (relatively) bad performance was pretty simple - even
though Projectile would normally obtain the list of project files
pretty fast (e.g. by using <code>git ls-files</code>) it always did some
post-processing of the results (e.g. filtering, sorting, etc), which
is a very slow operation in Elisp on a big dataset.</p>

<p>Today I've added <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/commit/e3007ae0324fb6679a6b3dac5c63191ce907115e">a new indexing
method</a>
that simply dispenses with all of the post-processing and gives you
the raw power you always craved for. It's called <code>turbo-alien</code> (yeah,
yeah - naming is hard!) and it's going to be the default indexing
method going forward (starting with Projectile 1.1 which should be released pretty soon).</p>

<p>You can read a bit more about it in Projectile's
<a href="https://www.projectile.mx/en/latest/configuration/#project-indexing-method">manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself missing Projectile's old behaviour just add the following to your config:</p>

<p><code>cl
(setq projectile-indexing-method 'alien)
</code></p>

<p>The old tried and true <code>alien</code> method is still around, it's just no longer the default.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I encourage all of you to help out with some of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues">open tickets</a>
marked with "Help Wanted" or "Good First Issue" here. I'm trying to
clean-up shop after a long period of stagnation and I can certainly
use some help! :-)</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> The recent 1.0 release was just a precursor to some bigger changes I
had planned to do for quite a while. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Shortly after writing this post I've reconsidered the
<code>turbo-alien</code> naming and I opted to rename the old <code>alien</code> method to
<code>hybrid</code> (as it was truly a hybrid of <code>native</code> and <code>alien</code> indexing),
and to change the name of <code>turbo-alien</code> to simply <code>alien</code>. Naming is
hard! :-)</p>
