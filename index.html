  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while one of the biggest complaints people had about
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> was that the
<code>alien</code> indexing wasn&#8217;t fast enough (especially on big projects). The
reason for the (relatively) bad performance was pretty simple - even
though Projectile would normally obtain the list of project files
pretty fast (e.g. by using <code>git ls-files</code>) it always did some
post-processing of the results (e.g. filtering, sorting, etc), which
is a very slow operation in Elisp on a big dataset.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;ve added <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/commit/e3007ae0324fb6679a6b3dac5c63191ce907115e">a new indexing
method</a>
that simply dispenses with all of the post-processing and gives you
the raw power you always craved for. It&#8217;s called <code>turbo-alien</code> (yeah,
yeah - naming is hard!) and it&#8217;s going to be the default indexing
method going forward (starting with Projectile 1.1 which should be released pretty soon).</p>

<p>You can read a bit more about it in Projectile&#8217;s
<a href="https://www.projectile.mx/en/latest/configuration/#project-indexing-method">manual</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I encourage all of you to help out with some of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues">open tickets</a>
marked with &#8220;Help Wanted&#8221; or &#8220;Good First Issue&#8221; here. I&#8217;m trying to
clean-up shop after a long period of stagnation and I can certainly
use some help! :-)</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> The recent 1.0 release was just a precursor to some bigger changes I
had planned to do for quite a while. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in 2013 I wrote about my favourite productivity boost in Emacs,
namely <a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/11/12/a-crazy-productivity-boost-remap-return-to-control/">remapping Return to
Control</a>,
which in combination with the classic remapping of <code>CapsLock</code> to
<code>Control</code> makes it really easy to get a grip on Emacs&#8217;s obsession with
the Control key.</p>

<p>In the original article I suggested to OS X (now macOS) users the tool
<code>KeyRemap4MacBook</code>, which was eventually renamed to
<a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a>. Unfortunately this tool
stopped working in macOS Sierra, due to some internal kernel
architecture changes.</p>

<p>That was pretty painful for me as it meant that on my old MacBook
I couldn&#8217;t upgrade to the newest macOS editions and on my new
MacBook I couldn&#8217;t type properly in Emacs (as it came with Sierra pre-installed)&#8230;
Bummer!</p>

<p>Fortunately 2 years later this is finally solved - the Karabiner team
rewrote Karabiner from scratch for newer macOS releases and recently
added my dream feature to the new <code>Karabiner Elements</code>. Unlike in the
past though, this remapping is not actually bundled with Karabiner by
default, so you have to download and enable it manually from
<a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_and_return_to_ctrl">here</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s actually even better than what I had originally suggested, as
here it&#8217;s also suggested to use <code>CapsLock</code> with a dual purpose as
well - <code>Control</code> when held down and <code>Escape</code> otherwise.  I have no
idea how this never came to my mind, but it&#8217;s truly epic! A crazy
productivity boost just got even crazier!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a> is a popular Clojure
programming environment for Emacs.</p>

<p>In a nutshell - CIDER extends Emacs with support for interactive
programming in Clojure. The features are centered around <code>cider-mode</code>,
an Emacs minor-mode that complements <code>clojure-mode</code>. While <code>clojure-mode</code>
supports editing Clojure source files, <code>cider-mode</code> adds support for
interacting with a running Clojure process for compilation, debugging,
definition and documentation lookup, running tests and so on.</p>

<p>You can safely think of CIDER as SLIME (a legendary Common Lisp programming
environment) for Clojure - after all SLIME was the principle
inspiration for CIDER to begin with. If you&#8217;re interested in some
historical background you can check out my talk on the subject <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X-1fJm25Ww&amp;list=PLZdCLR02grLoc322bYirANEso3mmzvCiI&amp;index=6">The
Evolution of the Emacs tooling for
Clojure</a>.</p>

<p>Many people who are new to Lisps (and Emacs) really struggle with the concept of
&#8220;interactive programming&#8221; and are often asking what&#8217;s the easiest (and
fastest) way to &#8220;grok&#8221; (understand) it.</p>

<p>While CIDER has an extensive <a href="https://cider.readthedocs.io/">manual</a> and a section
on <a href="https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactive_programming/">interactive programming</a> there,
it seems for most people that&#8217;s not enough to get a clear understanding
of interactive programming fundamentals and appreciate its advantages.</p>

<p>I always felt what CIDER needed were more video tutorials on the
subject, but for one reason or another I never found the time to
produce any. In the past this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B_4vhsmRRI">amazing intro to
SLIME</a> really changed my
perception of SLIME and got me from 0 to 80 in like one hour. I wanted
to do the same for CIDER users! And I accidentally did this in a way
last year - at a FP conference I was attending to present CIDER, one
of the speakers dropped out, and I was invited to fill in for them
with a hands-on session on CIDER. It was officially named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYA4AAjLfT0">Deep Dive
into CIDER</a>, but probably
&#8220;Intro to CIDER&#8221; would have been a more appropriate name, and it&#8217;s
likely the best video introduction to CIDER around today. It&#8217;s
certainly not my finest piece of work, and I definitely have to
revisit the idea for proper high-quality tutorials in the future, but
it&#8217;s better than nothing. I hope at least some of you would find it useful!</p>

<p>You might also find some of the <a href="https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_resources/">additional CIDER
resources</a>
mentioned in the manual helpful.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Emacs you can evaluate Emacs Lisp pretty much anywhere - even
<a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/04/18/evaluate-emacs-lisp-in-the-minibuffer/">in the minibuffer</a>. Writing
Emacs Lisp in the minibuffer, however, is not exactly fantastic
experience out-of-the-box - there&#8217;s <code>TAB</code> completion, but what about
<code>eldoc</code> and <code>paredit</code> for instance?</p>

<p>If only there was a way to enable them&#8230; I suggested one trick in my
original post on <code>eval-expression</code>, but Emacs 24.4 made things even
easier by adding <code>eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook</code>. To enable
<code>eldoc</code> for minibuffer evaluations use this snippet:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook</span> <span class="nf">#&#39;</span><span class="nv">eldoc-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For <code>paredit</code> you can use this one:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook</span> <span class="nf">#&#39;</span><span class="nv">paredit-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Obviously you can do the same for any other minor mode you might need.</p>

<p>The best thing about this setup is that it will work with tools like
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/slime/slime">SLIME</a> as well (they have similar
commands which allow you to evaluate Clojure &amp; Common Lisp code and
those command trigger <code>eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook</code>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you know the name of some command, but you&#8217;ve forgotten its
keybinding(s) there are 3 common options to look the keybinding(s) up.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C-h f command-name</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This will display some information about the command in question in a help buffer.
Important bits of this information include where is the command defined, what are its
keybindingings if any, and its documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C-h w command-name</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This will display the keybindings of the command in the minibuffer. If you&#8217;re interested only
in the keybindings you should prefer this option over <code>C-h f</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>M-x command-name</code></li>
</ul>


<p>After you invoke some command using <code>M-x</code> you&#8217;ll see a suggestion to use
its keybinding instead in the minibuffer.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now, folks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By default Emacs has some pretty annoying audio notifications for
certain events (e.g. trying to move past the end of a buffer). You&#8217;ve
got two options to get rid of them. Option 1 is to replace them with visual
notifications (the Emacs frame will flash):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This doesn&#8217;t work well on OS X and is just as annoying (if not even
more), so I&#8217;d suggest going with option 2 instead - disable those
notifications completely:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">ring-bell-function</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ignore</span><span class="p">)</span>

<time datetime="2016-02-07T11:28:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 7<span>th</span>, 2016</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I hate the most while programming, is having to
manually adjust the indentation of some code, after I&#8217;ve moved or
renamed something in it. While it&#8217;s pretty easy to do such re-indent
operations using commands like <code>crux-indent-defun</code> or
advices like <code>crux-with-region-or-buffer</code> (you remember,
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/crux">crux</a>, right?), there&#8217;s an even more
efficient way to tackle the issue at hand. Enter
<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode">aggressive-indent-mode</a>.</p>

<p><code>aggressive-indent-mode</code>&#8217;s name is a bit of a misnomer - it should
probably have been named <code>auto-indent-mode</code>, as this is what it
does. When you edit your code it will adjust the indentation
automatically. It&#8217;s easier to show this than to explain it.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s one example showing <code>agressive-indent-mode</code> enabled in <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode/master/lisp-example.gif"></p>

<p>And another example using <code>cc-mode</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode/master/c-example.gif"></p>

<p>Provided you&#8217;ve installed the mode, enabling it for particular major modes is a piece of cake:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;emacs-lisp-mode-hook</span> <span class="nf">#&#39;</span><span class="nv">aggressive-indent-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;clojure-mode-hook</span> <span class="nf">#&#39;</span><span class="nv">aggressive-indent-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ruby-mode-hook</span> <span class="nf">#&#39;</span><span class="nv">aggressive-indent-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to enable it in all major modes you can do this as well:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">global-aggressive-indent-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that this is not going to work well with modes like <code>python-mode</code>
and <code>haml-mode</code> where the proper indentation can&#8217;t be reliably
determined.  When <code>global-aggressive-indent-mode</code> is enabled it will
not affect major modes listed in <code>aggressive-indent-excluded-modes</code>.</p>

<p>Why is this a bad idea? Because you might change the keybinding of the
command in question (e.g. <code>projectile-switch-project</code>, but you might
forget to update messages like this. Is there a better way?
<code>substitute-command-keys</code> to the rescue:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">message</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">substitute-command-keys</span> <span class="s">&quot;Press &lt;\\[projectile-switch-project]&gt; to switch between projects&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will produce exactly the same message as before and you&#8217;re
guaranteed the keybinding will always be in sync with the command.</p>

<p>Neat!</p>

<p>P.S. If you want to check interactively the keybinding of some command use <code>C-h f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>). Here&#8217;s
an example - <code>C-h f RET projectile-switch-project RET</code> will produce this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="nv">projectile-switch-project</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">an</span> <span class="nv">interactive</span> <span class="nv">compiled</span> <span class="nv">Lisp</span> <span class="nv">function.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">It</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">bound</span> <span class="nv">to</span> <span class="nv">C-c</span> <span class="nv">p</span> <span class="nv">p,</span> <span class="nv">s-p</span> <span class="nv">p,</span> <span class="nv">&lt;menu-bar&gt;</span> <span class="nv">&lt;tools&gt;</span> <span class="nv">&lt;Projectile&gt;</span> <span class="nv">&lt;Switch</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">to</span> <span class="nv">project&gt;.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">projectile-switch-project</span> <span class="k">&amp;optional</span> <span class="nv">ARG1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can also check which command is bound to some key with <code>C-h k</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By default in Emacs the <code>Tab</code> key does only indentation. If some major
mode provides completion of some form, you normally have to trigger it
with <code>M-Tab</code>. In most window managers, however, this keybinding is used to
switch between open windows, which makes it a bit hard to use out of the box.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a simple trick to augment the default <code>Tab</code> behavior. Just put
this in your Emacs config:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">tab-always-indent</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nv">complete</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, when you press <code>Tab</code> one time it will indent and if you press it
again you&#8217;ll get completion candidates. If the indentation at point is
already correct you&#8217;ll get the completion candidates right away. As an
added bonus - you don&#8217;t really need <code>M-Tab</code> anymore.</p>

<p>Simple and neat! One really has to wonder why this isn&#8217;t the default
behavior.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the longest time <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>
included the function <code>prelude-goto-symbol</code> (bound to <code>C-c i</code>).
It basically allowed you to jump to any definition in the current source file
using <code>imenu</code> behind the curtains.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve found an even better option - the package
<a href="https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere">imenu-anywhere</a>. It works in a pretty similar
manner but gives you the ability to jump to any definition in any currently open buffer.
That&#8217;s quite handy and it greatly reduces the need to use something like <code>etags</code>.</p>

<p>As an added bonus - <code>imenu-anywhere</code> features helm integration.</p>

<p>This is a very handy package and I encourage you to give it a go!</p>

<p>P.S. Prelude users should simply upgrade to the latest version of
Prelude (it already uses it).</p>
