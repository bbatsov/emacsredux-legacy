My name is [Bozhidar](http://batsov.com). I'm an Emacs buff (and a
software engineer) from Bulgaria.

I happen to maintain a few Emacs related projects:

* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - An Emacs distribution built on top of GNU Emacs 24
* [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Project Interaction Library for Emacs, that stays out of your way
* [guru-mode](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - An annoying companion on your journey to Emacs mastery
* [rubocop-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Emacs integration for [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
* [zenburn-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) - The Zenburn color theme, ported to Emacs
* [solarized-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs) - The Solarized color theme, ported to Emacs

I was also the original maintainer of [WikEmacs](http://wikemacs.org) - a community documentation portal for Emacs.

Why does **Emacs Redux** exist?

While many people consider Emacs(and vim for that matter) a remnant of
the Dark Ages of computing, we (the crazy Emacs devotees) know better!
It's time to bring Emacs under the spotlight once more and showcase
its unique advantages over the more "traditional" (conventional) text
editors and integrated development environments.

In this blog dedicated to the One True
Editor I'll be sharing with you useful tips and tricks to make your
experience with Emacs more productive and more enjoyable.
